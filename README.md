# Evaluating App Ideas Protocol
When evaluating ideas, you can consider the following:

Mobile: How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
What makes your app more than a glorified website?
Try for 2 or more of these: maps, camera, location, audio, sensors, push, real-time, etc
Story: How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
How clear is the value of this app to your audience?
How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?
Market: How large or unique is the market for this app?
What's the size and scale of your potential user base?
Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people?
Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
Habit: How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
How frequently would an average user open and use this app?
Does an average user just consume your app or do they create?
Scope: How well-formed is the scope for this app?
How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the end of the program?
Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?
How clearly defined is the product you want to build?
